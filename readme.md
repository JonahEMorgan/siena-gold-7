## Siena 2023 programming contest: Gold #7

This is a challenging problem which I used breadth-first search to solve. The board state is stored using bitboard techniques as a 32-bit integer. This allows fast operations and give me the ability to precompute every move as a sequence of numbers. My solution is quite fast, and it even runs on my machine in only 0.023 milliseconds. `triangle.c` is cool because looks like a triangle. `triangle.c` is the same as both `main.c` and `minfied.c`, but I formatted it uniquely to suit the challenge.
